# ProcessJocky

**Idea**
* A task/todo list that is build from a respository of provided or user generated processes

**Example**

You have someone that has a common task they do everyday for their role. Someone new is being trained to help this person or you have someone new starting in a role you have a lot of processes for, eg. A Helpdesk. While someone would sit down and go through how to use a new system on how to take calls, log tickets, send emails, process customer and department requests it could be given to them via a website in task form. "Follow the process" is just part of the workflow. 


**Usage**

Give the process a title, 
Give a set of tasks that are needed to complete this process
Save the process to a respository so that it can by pulled by anyone. 

**Goals**
* Find something to develop this on, likely a web app of some kind. Javascript?.. I would likely need to learn Node.js or something
* Will likely need some kind of database system. I've looked at CouchDB as I like the idea of how it works... could just output xml files at the start, just something to create, save and load process/task lists.
